# core-hunter3-example
Establishing core collection for different crops: 
- chickpea, 
- fieldpea,
- lupin 
- lentils

Objective:
core collection will be based on two objectives.

Distance based measures

Average entry-to-nearest-entry distance (diversity)

Average accession-to-nearest-entry distance (representativeness)

steps:

  SNP calling and data Filtering

  Multi-dimensional scaling all lines

  selection of core collection using core hunter

The package corehunter is available on CRAN and can be installed with

install.packages("corehunter")
library(corehunter)

overlaying Multi-dimensional scaling with the core selection to visualise the genetic diversity and representativeness
